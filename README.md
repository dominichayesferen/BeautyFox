BeautyFox is a **Mozilla Firefox 115 - latest ESR** CSS and JS modification that aims to revive the look and feel of Internet Explorer releases, from the clean minimalist essence of Internet Explorer 9 to 11 to the toolbar-heavy tabbed interface of Internet Explorer 7 and 8 (with Classic Internet Explorer to come in the future), while also bringing beta designs and obscure content to the limelight and retrofitting new content into every design.


## Coming from Beautyfox 1.0?

Just install the latest release normally by deleting your `chrome` folder and placing the `chrome` folder in its place - upon launching Beautyfox all the settings from 1.0 will be automatically migrated to the new Beautyfox release.


## Want old Chromium designs instead?

Check out Geckium, Beautyfox's younger brother for replicating Chromium's historic designs, at [https://github.com/angelbruni/Geckium](https://github.com/angelbruni/Geckium).


# Compatibility

Beautyfox is designed for the following platforms:

- Linux (tested on Feren OS)
- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10 (with Native Controls Patch)
- Windows 11
- macOS (tested on Sequoia)

However,

- Beautyfox can be used on the latest, non-ESR, releases of Firefox, **but** Beautyfox is only designed to be used in ESR and therefore may have issues in non-ESR Firefox releases 
- Compatibility with Firefox forks is never guaranteed - minor adjustments will be made by Beautyfox to accommodate itself in Firefox forks, but issues not seen in Firefox may still occur.
- Due to the nature of how their packages are created, Beautyfox **CANNOT** be used in Mozilla Firefox from Flathub nor Ubuntu (and Snap Store). Ubuntu users will have to install Firefox [from the Mozilla PPA](https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/ubuntu/ppa#:~:text=sudo%20add%2Dapt%2Drepository%20ppa%3Amozillateam/ppa) in order to use Beautyfox.


# Instructions

**Beautyfox 2.0 is currently an early work in progress and is therefore not available yet - once available, you can download daily builds from Actions.**

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to only get JavaScript-powered Firefox modifications (such as Beautyfox) from sources that you trust, such as [Beautyfox's official repository](https://github.com/dominichayesferen/Beautyfox) - JavaScript-powered modifications have full access to Firefox's functionality, including unrestricted access, to data inside and outside of Firefox, and file manipulation.

> [!NOTE]
> Once running for the first time, Beautyfox will restart Firefox automatically 1-2 times while it sets up required settings, migrations, and so on - if Firefox doesn't re-appear after restarting itself, terminate Firefox and launch it again (that is an upstream bug with Firefox).
